// TODO to retain stats properly even on power cycle or reset
// - add stats for deaths and resets
// - save stats to SRAM at each door transition and when pausing/unpausing,
//   with a "end transaction" marker
// x have a clean copy of said stats to SRAM when saving at save station
// x when loading, load "door/pause stats" if not corrupted, "save station stats" otherwise
// x reduce saved area size to accomodate actual stats size for both performance and the fact
//   that we store two copies of stats
// x keep timer running in game menus after resets, and keep going if we load the same save
//   file

// How?
// x at boot, reload RTA timer value from last save slot. If no save slot, it will be reset
//   at new game anyway
// x at load, either load the correct version of stats (see above) and put them in RAM.
//   if we load last save slot, keep RTA timer going, if not, take it from SRAM
//   update last save slot in SRAM to retrieve after power cycle
// x add additional save_stats routine for door transition save
// - hijack door transition in a place where we have time to do stuff without creating
//   apparent lag, and save stats from there
// - also call this when pausing/unpausing (do that in tracking.asm)
