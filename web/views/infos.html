	  <li>rando: new option to match the requested quantities of minors instead of using probabilities.</li>
	  <li>rando: new option for Morph placement: late, prevents Morph to be found in early game (Crateria/Blue Brinstar). Mostly relevant for area mode, to find morph in peculiar places.</li>

    <p>
      Hello @randomizer,</br>
      We've released a new version of the VARIA Randomizer dubbed "Randomize the Randomizer":
      <ul>
	<li>New options to randomize the parameters used by the Randomizer</li>
	<li>The parameters used are now displayed in the credits</li>
	<li>As we had for Bosses and Hellruns, we now have difficulties for hard rooms: X-Ray and Gauntlet, so we've removed a few techniques for these rooms</li>
	<li>Now there's techniques for better settings of Gravity-less movement underwater</li>
	<li>New Randomizer's parameter to influence choice of the next location based on its difficulty</li>
      </ul>
      As a result don't forget to update your presets before using the Randomizer.

	Hi @randomizer!</br>
	We updated the VARIA (http://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/) to fix two issues:
	<ul>
	  <li>1) The "too much spospo" bug. Now, the probability you would have to fight it is ~30% in slowest/slow, ~5% in medium, and ~0% in fast/fastest. All in all if you choose a random speed, there is a 1/7 chance to have to do the fight.</li>
	  <li>2) When "start at Ceres" was selected instead of "start at landing site", the stats counters in the credits were wrong and glitched out. It is now fixed, thanks @andrew (original credits/stats patch author), Smiley and PJBoy from metconst for their help, this was a tricky one to fix.</li>
	  </ul>
	Enjoy!

	<ul>
	  <li>the layout patches are now optional (for EasyDanger)</li>
	  <li>the save the animals suprise patches are now available (for andrew)</li>
	  <li>there's now a tutorial and contextual help to explain the parameters of the Randomizer and Solver in greater details</li>
	  <li>the randomized ROMs are now generated a lot faster (between x2 and x3 gain)</li>

	Hi @randomizer !<br>
	We made an update to the VARIA randomizer and solver ( http://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/ ). Not much in terms of new features, but lots of work behind the scenes:
	<ul>
	  <li> stabilized and improved randomizer algorithm: now it can be trolly with minor items as well (especially in slow/slowest speeds), be sure to try it! ;)</li>
	  <li> fixed logic bugs affecting both rando and solver</li>
	  <li> fixed Normal/Hard Total ROM patch set mapping for solver</li>
	</ul>
	This is an intermediate release, there's more in the works, namely: drastic performance improvements, a tutorial for the website explaining the plethora of settings and other surprises!

	We updated the VARIA (http://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/randomizer). Among the obligatory bugfixes, the following new features are available:
	<ul>
	  <li> Skip intro/start at Ceres option, as suggested by @Di10 and @BlackEliteJohn</li>
	  <li> Added optional patch to speed up doors and elevators transitions</li>
	  <li> Added a Super Fun Times feature for those who like the feeling of Dessy rando masochist seeds</li>
	  <li> Ability to have a random progression speed instead of choosing one</li>

	@randomizer Hello,</br>
	Using the presets (for each technique you can say if you know it and your perceived difficulty for it) from the solver we've made a new randomizer: the VARIA randomizer (Very Adaptive Randomizer of Items for Anyone)</br>
	It can be found here: http://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/randomizer</br>
	Its features:
	<ul>
	  <li>generate a randomized ROM which can be finished using the techniques of the given preset</li>
	  <li>can limit the max difficulty for reaching a location</li>
	  <li>can choose the probability of each minors and the percentage of minors available</li>
	  <li>can choose the quantity of Energy/Reserve Tanks</li>
	  <li>can do a full randomization of the majors</li>
	  <li>can influence how fast the randomizer places the progression items</li>
	  <li>can spread the progression items in all areas with maximum distance between them</li>
	  <li>several optional patches are available:
	    <ul>
	      <li>allow the aim buttons to be assign to any button</li>
	      <li>remove fanfare when picking up an item</li>
	      <li>allow Samus to start spinning in mid air after jumping or falling</li>
	      <li>play the music with MSU1 chip on SD2SNES</li>

      <p>
	Hello,</br>
	We've added a few things to the randomized roms solver (http://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/):
	<ul>
	  <li>display the number of techniques used to solve the rom</li>
	  <li>in the spoiler display the techniques used for each location</li>
	  <li>for each techniques display the rooms where it's used with links to the wiki</li>
	  <li>update the CSS of the website</li>

    <li>
      <h4>2018/01/22</h4>
      <p>
	Hello,</br>
	With a friend we've developed a solver for the randomized Super Metroid roms: http://randommetroidsolver.pythonanywhere.com/</br>
	Tell it what you know (and how hard you find particular tricks), and it'll tell you if you can finish your seed, and how hard it will be, without spoiling the seed.</br>
	It's useful for people who hasn't yet mastered all the Super Metroid tricks required by the randomizers.</br>
	Features:
	<ul>
	  <li> works with randomized roms from Dessyreqt randomizer and (Total, Foosda, Leodox) randomizer</li>
	  <li> somewhat realistic navigation algorithm</li>
	  <li> pretty much all tricks and difficult rooms/areas have their setting, with video explanation when we found one, so you can actually learn the tricks if you want</li>
	  <li> website front end</li>
	  <li> save/load your presets on the website without having to create an account</li>
	  <li> boss difficulty is estimated as well</li>
	  <li> hell runs are taken into account in navigation</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
