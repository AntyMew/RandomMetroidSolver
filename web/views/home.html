  <h3 class="center">Welcome to Very Adaptive Randomizer of Items and Areas for Super Metroid</h3>
  <p>
  Here, you will be able to generate as many VARIAtions of Super Metroid as you want, by Randomizing Item locations, and even the connections between the main Areas!<br/>If you're not an uberskilled speedrunner, have no fear, neither are we. It is Very Adaptive to all skill levels, and you are guaranteed to be able to finish a randomized ROM, granted that you create your skill preset, or use a standard one in your range.<br/>
  To find your way in these sometimes not so easy randomized ROMs (aka 'seeds') you will be able to use a Solver, to estimate the seed's difficulty or have a full spoiler log. Even better, you can use the interactive Item Tracker to help you as you play along. For area-randomized seeds, the Tracker can also be used in a more simple way just to help you keep track of the area connections without any additional help.
